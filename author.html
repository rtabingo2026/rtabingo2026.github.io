        <h1>About the Author</h1>
		<p>I'm Raph, a Gen Z and a high school student who's trying to navigate my way around the physical and non-physical world we live in. I have always been fascinated about puzzles -- word and mind puzzles that I read in books and the 1st edition of Kindle Fire as well as those I played from the 1st generation iPod Touch. Then came my first Rubik's cube and my first set of dominoes and the rest is history.</p>

        <p>I could pass hours playing these things, with my head wrapped around a puzzle I try to solve. They are intriguing, challenging and rewarding to figure out. In this page, I hope I could entice you to give puzzles a second look. Enjoy! </p>
