				<h2>About Fresh 'n Local Eats</h2>
				<p>A hole-in-the-wall established in 2022, Fresh ‘n Local Eats aims to serve quality and filling meals using fresh meat and local produce sourced from the growers and farmers in Central and North Luzon. The value of supporting local farmers and neighborhood or backyard growers has never been more pronounced when the pandemic struck, disrupting the food supply chain and impacting the livelihood of Filipino farmers. Our restaurant is committed to get most, if not all, of the ingredients in our dishes from the local growers. As Fresh ‘n Local Eats grows, we are also expanding our backyard farming to include more greens.</p>
